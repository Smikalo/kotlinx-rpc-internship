# kotlinx-rpc-internship
This is a project for this internship: https://internship.jetbrains.com/projects/1718

Done according to this RFC Style Guide as per task requirements: https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7322

See the final rendered design proposal pdf under main.pdf. Everything else are just latex compilation files

The code snippets suggested in the final paper are provided as a sample implementation in accordance to the recent standards and best practices for kotlinx libraries. Feel free to adapt this code for your implementation.

The proposed RFC has been written with 2 main goals in mind:
1. To implement as many features of the original json-rpc 2.0 protocol as possible
2. To make the final implementation flexible and extendable addition to kotlinx-rpc

You can read more on the additional goals and used approaches in more details in the RFC itself. Enjoy the read!
